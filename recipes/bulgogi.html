        <p>This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. You can substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety. My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! Serve over rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 ½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon cayenne</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine onion, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, sesame seeds, cayenne, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag.</li>
                <li>Pour 1/2 of the marinade into the bag.</li>
                <li>Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Set remaining marinade aside.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.</li>
                <li>Cook and stir chicken in the skillet until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour reserved marinade over chicken.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook and stir until chicken is coated and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            </ol>      
        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
            <p>You can substitute peanut oil for the sesame oil if desired. Add vegetables if you wish; I normally use carrot straws and sliced mushrooms. For a little more bite, I use a peppercorn medley grinder instead of black pepper.</p>
