    <h2>Chicken Noodle Soup Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Onions and Celery: In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.</li>
                <li>Broth: This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</li>
                <li>Chicken: Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</li>
                <li>Noodles: Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</li>
                <li>Carrots: Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the sautéed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.</li>
                <li>Basil and Oregano: Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Chicken Noodle Soup</h2>
        <p>You'll find the full recipe below, but here are a few tips to keep in mind while you make this classic chicken noodle soup recipe:

    <h3>Best Noodles For Chicken Noodle Soup</h3>
        <p>Egg noodles are the traditional choice for chicken noodle soup. Rotini and fusilli would work well too, but you can use whatever you have on hand in a pinch.

    <h3>Customize to Taste</h3>
        <p>We love the simplicity of this easy chicken noodle soup recipe. However, you can get creative with spices and seasonings. Reviewers say they like to add bay leaves, garlic, herbes de Provence, rosemary, and thyme.

    <h3>Improvise With Ingredients You Already Have</h3>
        <p>This recipe lends itself to convenient, budget-friendly substitutions. Try rotisserie chicken instead of cooked chicken breasts, water and bouillon cubes instead of broth, or oil instead of butter.
    <h2>What Goes With Chicken Noodle Soup?</h2>
        <p>Chicken noodle soup is a meal in and of itself, so you don't really need to pair it with any sides (besides maybe a few saltine crackers). But, if you want to go the extra mile, try something bread-based to soak up all that delicious broth. Here are some delicious options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Biscuits</li>
                <li>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</li>
                <li>French Baguettes</li>
                <li>Classic Dinner Rolls</li>
                <li>Toasted Garlic Bread</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>How to Store Chicken Noodle Soup</h2>
        <p>Store leftover chicken noodle soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to four days.</p>
    <h2>Can You Freeze Chicken Noodle Soup?</h2>       
        <p>Yes! You can freeze chicken noodle soup — and you should if you don't plan to eat it within a few days. If you're making this recipe with the intention of freezing it, consider preparing the soup and noodles separately. Frozen noodles will break down and become mushy when thawed.</p>
        <p>To freeze chicken noodle soup (with or without the noodles), pour serving-sized portions of the cooled soup into freezer bags labeled with the date. Freeze for up to six months. Re-heat on the stove.</p>
    <h2>Detailed Ingredients list</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Detailed Directions</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes.</p>
